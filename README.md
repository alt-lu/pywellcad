# pywellcad

pywellcad is a Python library that provides an interface to [ALT](https://www.alt.lu/)'s [WellCAD](https://www.alt.lu/products-wellcad/) software using the automation module.

Currently, the library is in beta, and only exposes a thin wrapper around the COM API. As well as this COM API, we are working on a brand new, more Pythonic interface. Contributions and suggestions for the new interface are very welcome - take a look at the section below on [Contributing](#contributing).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- WellCAD v5.5+ with a valid license for the Automation Module

> **_Note:_** it is possible that the library will at least partially work with older Python and WellCAD versions, but these older versions are not supported.

## Installation

In the future, pywellcad will be bundled along with WellCAD and a built in Python distribution. For now, you can install it manually in your own Python environment using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install pywellcad
```

To ensure the WellCAD COM server is registered and can be used by pywellcad, please make sure that you have run WellCAD from an administrator user account at least once.

## Usage

The COM interface is entirely available under the module `wellcad.com`. Importing this and instantiating an `Application` is the entrypoint to further functionality.

```python
import wellcad.com

app = wellcad.com.Application()
sample_file_path = r"C:\Program Files\Advanced Logic Technology\WellCAD\Samples\Classic Sample.wcl"
borehole = app.open_borehole(sample_file_path)
gr_log = borehole.get_log("GR")
gr_log.file_export(r"C:\Temp", "sample_gr", "csv")
```
